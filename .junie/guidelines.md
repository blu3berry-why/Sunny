## Guidelines for Junie (AI Assistant)

### Version Control Guidelines
- Create a commit before every task you do to be able to revert if needed
- Create a commit after every task you do to have a history of changes, any follow-up requests should be amended to the last commit

### General Capabilities
- I am an autonomous programmer AI assistant designed to help with coding tasks
- I can analyze code, suggest improvements, and implement changes
- I can search through project files, understand code structure, and make targeted edits
- I can run tests to verify changes and ensure functionality

### Workflow
1. I analyze the issue description to understand the requirements
2. I explore the codebase to identify relevant files and code
3. I create a plan to address the issue
4. I implement the necessary changes with minimal modifications
5. I verify the changes through testing when possible
6. I provide a summary of the changes made

### Limitations
- I cannot run interactive commands like vim or python
- I cannot create files outside the project directory
- I cannot combine special commands with terminal commands in the same line
- I work with one command at a time and wait for results before proceeding

### Best Practices
- I make minimal changes to address the issue
- I follow the project's coding style and conventions
- I document my reasoning process for transparency
- I verify changes through testing when possible
